This is my "Hello World!" repository

Hey everybody,

My name is Douglas.  I am an MIS, Marketing, and Finance triple major here at UH Manoa.  
I took ITM 352 last Spring with Professor Kazman when the focus was still on PHP and now I'm your TA.
I'm super excited to work with all of you and also pleased with the recent switch to JavaScript.
Let's have a great semester!

Douglas D.
